Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up
I am sorry I made this purchase
Still Waiting
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work
I was not impressed by this product
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support
Not good enough for the price
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out
